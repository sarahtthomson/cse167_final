    <h1>Rigid Body Simulation</h1>

    <h3>Step 1: Rigid Bodies</h3>
        <h4>What are Rigid Bodies?</h4>
        <p>
            In this final project topic, we produce a physics-based animation. Specifically, we simulate rigid
            body motion in 3D.<br><br>
            In terms of affine transformations we learned in the course, it is easy to describe what happens for a rigid body. As a standard description, there is a model coordinate where the vertex
            position (and other attributes) of the geometric object are defined. Then,
            there is a model matrix T ∈ R<sup>4x4</sup>, that sends the positions in the model
            coordinate to the positions in the world coordinate:

    <h3>Step 2: Rotation of Rigid Bodies</h3>
        <h4>What are Rotational Bodies?</h4>
        <p>
            For a rigid body motion, it is T that changes over time,
            constituting an animation of object moving in the world. The vertex
            positions defined under the model coordinate remain static;
            they are stored in some vertex buers initially and never require
            any update. Moreover, for arigid body, the time-dependent model
            matrix always takes the form of “first a rotation about the center
            of mass, followed by a translation”:

    <h3>Step 3: Rotational Bodies Inertia</h3>
        <h4>What is Rotational Bodies Inertia?</h4>
        <p>
            A fundamental assumption of rigid body motion is that the moment of
            inertia depends only on the shape of the geometry, which is
            completely static when we are in the model coordinate.
            In short: M<sub>model</sub> is time-independent. A common practice
            is to set the model coordinate to align with the eigenvectors of
            Mmodel so that we can simply assume the M<sub>model</sub> would be:

            The angular momentum of the system is given by the following vector in the world coordinate:

        <h4>Conservation law</h4>
        <p>
            In a rigid body motion, we have conservation of energy and
            conservation of angular momentum. More precisely,
            <li>E<sub>kinetic</sub> remains constant. (Conservation of energy)</li> 
            <li>L remains constant (in the world coordinate). (Conservation of
            angular momentum)</li>
            <li>Mmodel ramins constant. (Rigidity)</li>
            These conservation laws alone allow us to develop the animation.
